## Deriv Feature Flag

This package provides feature flag functionality for mobile applications.

## Getting started

### To use the lints, add a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  deriv_feature_flag:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/deriv-com/flutter-deriv-packages.git
      path: packages/deriv_feature_flag
      ref: ref
```

### Configuring your .env file

Following keys should be added to your .env file:

```yaml
GROWTHBOOK_API_KEY=your_api_key
GROWTHBOOK_HOST_URL=your_host_url
```

### Initialize and provide your feature flags key,value pairs:

```dart
final config = FeatureFlagConfig(
    features: {
    'sample_feature_key': true,
  },
);
await DerivFeatureFlag().initialize(config);
```

Then use it in your project:

```dart
if(DerivFeatureFlag().isFeatureOn('sample_feature_key',defaultValue: false)){
    /// add the functionality that should be done if feature flag is on.
}

```
